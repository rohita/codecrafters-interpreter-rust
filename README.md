This is Rust implementation of Interpreters, which follows the book 
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom. This build an interpreter for
[Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), a simple
scripting language. Along the way, we learn about tokenization, ASTs,
tree-walk interpreters and more.
